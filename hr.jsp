        <h1>*HR ROUND*</h1>
        <p>
        <h2><b>Why is the HR round in an interview effective?</b></h2></p>
        <p> * Functional or skill fitment - most referred as technical Interview emphasises on your current skill levels and ability to do the current job</p>
        <p> * Competency or cognitive fitment - ensures your potential and upskill possibility in the organisation based on the competencies required by the organisation.</p>
        <p> * Culture or organisation fitment - this is how an individual fits in the organisation in terms of value system, cultural nuances, individual priorities (compensation, growth prospects, career aspirations) and organisational perspectives. Mainly looks at the softer fitment aspects or the success of an individual in the organisational context.</p>

        <h2><b>What happens in an HR interview?</b></h2></p>
        <p>It is usually the final round of any recruitment process where the company or the recruiter wants to check your mentality and personality in the context of the position offered. He wants to know whether or not you’ll fit into the company culture easily . Also whether you have the “right” attitude towards your work or life on the whole.</p>
        <p>So basically for any HR , the belief is  “My men are my money.” and he hence he wants to hire the correct people for the position as his organization’s immediate or in some cases ,long term future depends on it.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><b>What are the ways to crack the HR round?</b></h2></p>
        <p> 1. Does this candidate have the knowledge and experience required for producing results as per the job requirement? (This is the reason why they probe into the projects completed by you.)</p>
        <p> 2. Can this candidate consistently produce the expected results if selected? (This is the reason why many organizations say they want consistent 60+ in at least 6 or 7 out of 8 semesters.)</p>
        <p> 3. Is this candidate the best fit out of the candidates shortlisted for the position?</p>
        <p> 4. Will this candidate gel well with the team and the organization after he/she joins? (They also try to gauge if you are a loner / solo performer or a team player.)</p>
        <p> 5. Does this candidate possess the type of communication & leadership skills required for the job to be done? (This can be gauged through group discussions as well as interviews.)</p>
        <p> 6. Does this candidate have a potential for further growth in our organization or will he/she not be able to grow in our organization because of his/her limited capabilities/potential?</p>
